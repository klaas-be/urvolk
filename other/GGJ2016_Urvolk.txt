Urvolk

("Urvolk", German for "anncient civilisation")

This is a prototype for a stone age based strategy game.

At the beginning we have a villager, we then perform one of four rituals to either get another villager, 
conjure rain, increase wood chopping rate or sacrifice one of our villagers to increase our settlers faith.

These rituals cost a specific amount of our four resources. (food, wood, faith and people) 
The cost of the population increasing ritual will double upon each activation.

We can deploy our villagers in three different buildings (seclect villager via left mouse button, and choose building with right click). 
If deployed there they will generate food, wood or faith.



Due to the fact that this is a prototype, as of now we do not have a real goal or win or loose condition. 

Please note that there might be a problem with running the game in fullscreen mode (MouseOffset).


However this jam was a wonderful opportunity to craft this prototype, and we will continue to work on it as a pet project.
